As Marceline's eyes adjusted to the low light, a cavern materialized in front of her. It appeared to have been chiseled out a mountain with rudimentary tools. Along the sides of the walls, there were deep uneven grooves.

There was an ambient blue glow that dimly lit the interior. It permeated every inch of the room with no discernable source, as if the very air itself was luminous.

The sound of dripping water was echoing through the chamber. Each droplet bouncing lightly, from wall to wall in irregular patterns.

Shapes began to form in her vision. She wasn't sure if the glow was getting brighter or if she was adjusting to the light.

There were a few tools leaned against the wall in haphazard fashion. There was a pile of unidentifiable junk in the farthest corner. The floor was completely covered in dirt. Or maybe the whole floor was dirt. There was a thin layer of moisture that enveloped the whole room. Marceline rubbed her fingers together and could feel the wetness between them.

She began walking towards the center of the room. Each step rendering a light squeak under her boots.

Standing in the center, she could see everything in the cavern with the same level of clarity. 

Suddenly, the pile of junk began to move. Startled, she jumped back, instinctively grabbing for her sword.

The junk pile was rising straight upwards. The top of it was over six feet high. 

Two small orbs began illuminated near the top of the pile. They were the same cobalt blue as the ambient glow but with a much more dense intensity.

As the pile rose a bit further, most of the garbage fell and rolled away, leaving only a single armor-clad figure holding a claymore that was as tall as Marceline.

The armor completely covered the figure, with the exception of the two orbs that shone through it. It was made of hundreds of individual pieces that overlapped forming a metal carapace.

There were still a few pieces of trash that had been hooked into the various crevices. Gravity had not pulled them all to the ground.

The armored being was now standing about seven feet tall. It's head mere inches from the ceiling of the corner it was in.

It began walking towards Marceline. With each step, another piece of trash fell off.

After a few steps it asked: “Interloper...why are you here?" It’s deep voice echoing throughout the chamber.

It continued its movement, not waiting for an answer. It was dragging the claymore behind it. Small sparks ignited each time the sword struck a rock.

It stopped only a few feet away, it's blue eyes piercing through Marceline's very existence.

She swallowed hard. 

"I seek the Masters treasure." She said finally, not entirely sure of herself

"Not all of it!" She added.

"And why would it make a difference to me if you pilfer some or all?" The being responded. Each word spoken with deliberate irreverence.

It continued, "I am the Keeper. I was not ordered to keep some. I was charged to keep all."

Marceline frowned briefly, smiled then responded, "Well, friend. It would seem like you've got a pretty tight contract to keep but I nearly got eaten by a murder of books earlier and I'm not looking to leave here empty handed."

The Keeper moved it's sword in front of it and slammed the blade into the earth. It was slow but determined. 

"There is only one way you are going to leave here…"

"Alright alright...let's just get to it then." She said, cutting it off mid-sentence.

"So, be it."

The Keeper withdrew it's sword from the ground. Small sparks flew out from the tip of the blade.

Marceline noticed this and muttered, "Oh shit, earth magic."

The Keeper Drew it's sword behind it and began a swing right for her midsection. She quickly ducked under the blade and moved around behind the Keeper. However, the Keeper seemed to anticipate this and had spun around as it completed its swing. She only had moments to duck down again to prevent her head from being cleaved from her body.

She quickly jumped back, sliding an extra foot on the wet ground.

The blade was beginning to glow blue along the edges. The intensity of the light grew brighter as it reached the tip. It was charging up.

Marceline was a full 20 feet away from the Keeper now. It was holding the sword at its side, the glowing tip pointing directly at Marceline's chest. It drew it back as far as it could then thrust it forward.

The lightning that was building up in the blade exploded forward towards Marceline. Her only reaction was to bring her sword up to meet the bolt in an attempt to deflect it.

She failed. 

The bolt of earth energy hit her square in the chest, knocking her back against the opposite wall. All the air in her body was forced out of her in an instant. Her sword flew away in an unknown direction.

The Keeper was slowly walking towards her, it's blade now extinguished.

Marceline gasped for air. After multiple attempts, her lungs finally expanded. She coughed viciously, spewing blood into the air.

"Note to self," she said between coughs. "do not get in the way of that shit again."
